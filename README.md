# Filters to SQL queries

I am a security professional in a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. I recently discovered some potential security issues related to login attempts and employee machines.
My task is to examine the organization's data in its employees and log_in_attempts tables. I will have to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate potential security issues.
